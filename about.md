Hello, and welcome to my blog! I am Anomitra Saha, and since you have happened to chance upon this page, I'll take the opportunity to let you know who I am and what I do. I'll make it quick, I promise!

I am a undergrad student, pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology at **National Institute of Technology, Durgapur**. 

Computers and programming has fascinated me since my childhood, and my degree has afforded me a great opportunity to turn my passion into a career.

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.


I have always delighted at building and designing software -- it gives me a sense of profound pleasure to develop something which helps a lot of people. I have spent my time on many mini-projects, among which are [a news article scraper](https://github.com/anomitra/articleScraper), [a Fantasy Cricket game](https://github.com/anomitra/FreePL-cricinfo-crawler) and [a one-player maze solving game](https://github.com/anomitra/MazeGame).    

PS: This blog is Open Source. You can [check out the code](https://github.com/anomitra/anomitra.github.io) if you want!

Apart from this, I am a huge football enthusiast and love watching, reading and discussing about the game. Literature and music are also passions I hold very dear to my heart.

> You string some letters together, and you make a word. You string some words together, and you make a sentence, then a paragraph, then a chapter. Words have power.

One of the things I enjoy doing the most is writing -- in fact, had I not been a software developer, I would probably be a writer in some capacity. 

The motivation behind this blog was to coerce myself into writing stuff every now and then, as well as to provide me with an outlet for my thoughts, musings and rants. I write about all of my myriad interests here, ranging from tech to sports to music -- so I hope everyone will find something that he/she will like!

Right.. Thank you for reading through all of that. If you want to read some posts, you might want to browse to the [homepage](http://anomitra.me). You might also want to view my [résumé](#), or you might just want to [talk to me](http://anomitra.me/contact). About anything. Really.

Good day!
